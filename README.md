# eh_subjects

Subjects for the eh program

Example Subject and Syntax:

~~~
[//]: # (sample, testing)
#Sample Subject

This is a sample subject for eh. Subjects use basic markdown syntax. The
only exception is that the things in the paren on line 1, are the
'triggers' that eh will look for when someone types `eh <subject>`. In this
case it will show up for 'sample' or 'testing'.

A block quote looks like this:

```
this is a block quote
```

You can make a list with this format:

- have the single line whitespace above after the ':'
- prefix with some character like '-' or '*'
- you can also use numbers like: 1., 2., etc.
